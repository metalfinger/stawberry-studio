# Dream chat harness: the root-fix plan

The single source of truth for rebuilding the dream chat harness from its root. Read this first in any new
session; update the status table and the log at the end of every step.

## The aim

Every picture of a dream right on the first take, because the preparation is right. The harness is the
preparation: the breakdown into dream, sequence, scene, shot and cut; how each cut connects to its shot, scene,
the sketches, the cuts before it and its in-between pictures; the camera and every other parameter; and from all
of it, the best prompt for that cut with the best references attached, each named in the prompt with a clear
instruction. Drawing the picture is the last step. Jev is the fast judge of the decisions inside the preparation.
General film-making rules apply to every dream; nothing is patched for one dream.

## Standing rules for this work

1. **No new pictures** until the harness passes its evals. Tests use prompts rebuilt from saved dreams
   (`plan.ts`), fake-picture simulations (`simulate.ts`, `evals/replay.ts` with `DREAMCHAT_PROVIDER=fake`) and
   labelled sets. Paid drawing needs the owner's go-ahead.
2. **Each step has its eval written before it is built**, and is not done until the eval passes and an
   independent review confirms it serves its purpose.
3. **Fix the mechanism, never the dream.** Every failure is classified against the root causes first; a fix adds
   or corrects a general rule; no incident-specific regex or word list without a test over every saved dream.
4. **Behind a switch** until measured; the default stays today's behaviour until the step passes.
5. **Tests green, typecheck clean** on every commit; commit prefixes `feat:`/`fix:`/`test:`/`docs:`.
6. **Report every finished step to the owner:** what improved, the tests run and their results, with a push
   notification. Otherwise keep going step by step until the whole harness is ready.
7. **Improve from every test.** When a step's tests or review find a gap or a better way, fix it (as a general
   rule) before moving on, and log what was found and what changed.
8. **Money:** $21 is left and there is no more after it. Spend only where a picture is the only way to prove a
   step (planned: about $3 after S4, about $3 after S5, about $10 for S10), redrawing only the moments that failed
   for that reason, old against new, judged by the owner. Record every cost in the log.

## The system being built

One **cut sheet** per cut is the spine everything is assembled from:

| Layer | What it holds | Where |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Vertical: the tree | dream -> sequence -> scene -> shot -> cut; each value inherited from the level above, with where it came from (said, chosen, read, derived, guessed, default) | `tree.ts` (built; only the panel reads it today) |
| Horizontal: the story record | each person, place and thing's look before any change, typed changes, and at each cut who and what is in view, how each looks now, who holds what | `record.ts` (shadow; being wired in) |
| Relations | each cut's relation to earlier cuts (same setup, same side, reverse, new place, jump) and its in-between pictures | `continuity.ts` |
| Tags | shot role (pov, over-the-shoulder, insert, master, two-shot, reaction, wide), camera relation, change, held thing, crowd, animal, vehicle, weather, flight/water/transformation | to build from the three above |
| Checks (Jev layer 2) | only the questions a cut's tags call for, from a library of film-making and continuity rules, each question with its labelled set | to build |
| Assembly | `assembleCut(sheet)`: the prompt, each fact once, and the references (sketches, earlier cuts, in-between pictures, the grey mock-up only when its tags say it helps), each with its instruction | to build; replaces `framePrompt`'s block joining |
| Drawing, then judging | fal draws; the judge (Claude, for now) checks the picture | exists |

## Steps and status

| # | Step | Status | Eval that proves it |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| S0 | Eval foundation: a prompt-case set from the person's 122 verdicts and notes, a runner that rebuilds prompts from saved dreams and scores them, the free simulation corpus as regression | not started | Every noted fault has a case; the runner reproduces today's failures |
| S1 | Story record carries state (water, suitcase, who holds what, presence) into continuity, in-between pictures and prompts | building | The state cases in S0 pass; no regressions on the corpus |
| S2 | Stop stand-in checks deciding: the pre-draw prompt check and storyboard check only log | not started | No moment held or reworded; corpus unchanged otherwise |
| S3 | The cut sheet: tree (vertical) + record (horizontal) + relations + tags, one per cut | not started | Every input the prompt needs comes from the sheet; no fact computed in two places |
| S4 | Camera rules and shot roles: the scene's line, a reverse angle turns the room (what is now left, right, behind), point-of-view shots show at most hands, vehicle screen direction, same setup means the same camera | not started | The camera cases in S0 pass (snow train m2/m3, lighthouse m2, orchard m2/m7) |
| S5 | References and variants: one image per subject; in-between pictures only when an edit carries several changes; variants kept and reusable; the grey mock-up as a reference chosen by tag | not started | Reference cases pass; no moment gets two images of one subject |
| S6 | `assembleCut`: prompt and references from the sheet, each fact once, action as visible facts; retire the regex clean-ups one by one | not started | All S0 cases pass; word-level diff reviewed on every saved dream |
| S7 | Jev layer 2: checks routed by tags, a question library from the film rules, a labelled set per question; a check may hold a picture only if it predicts pictures | not started | Each question meets its bar on its labelled set |
| S8 | Listening: every reply checked against its move; major picture gaps asked openly, minor ones imagined and marked; the retelling ends with the moments | not started | Listening cases on the simulated dreams pass |
| S9 | Record of what was drawn, and staleness; sequences and look keys | not started | Stale pictures found on saved dreams |
| S10 | Only after S0-S9 pass: a paid benchmark on the five replay dreams, judged by the owner | waiting | Owner's first-take rate against today's |

## Where things are

- Evidence: `evals/story-pictures.json` (62 pictures, the owner's verdicts and notes), `evals/paired-verdicts.json`
  (20 moments drawn three ways), `evals/picture-judge.md`, `evals/benchmark.json` + `evals/replay.ts` (five dreams
  replayed from the style choice), `evals/paired.ts`.
- Findings so far: the owner judged 36 of 62 right on the first take. Guiding a picture by the grey mock-up, by an
  edit of the picture before, or by sketches alone made no clear difference (10, 11, 9 of 20), but in 18 of 20
  moments at least one of three draws was right, and a judge keeping the best of three got 16 of 20. The faults the
  owner marked most: state not carried from the picture before, the room not turning when the camera turns,
  point-of-view shots drawn in third person, the dreamer changing, proportions in edits.
- The tree's own design: step 1 was designed in full; steps 2-8 of that design are folded into S3-S9 above.

## Log

- 26 Sep: plan written. S1 building (story record into continuity and prompts). A keep-the-best-of-takes switch is
  being added, off by default, as a later safety net.
